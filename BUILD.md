# Build Instructions

## Windows x86.

### Prerequisites

Install and run [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). The installer allows you to choose specific components. Select `Desktop development with C++`. You can untick everything you don't need in Installation details, but you must keep `MSVC` ticked. You may also keep `C++ CMake tools for Windows` ticked as you'll need **cmake**. Alternatively you can install **cmake** from the [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) and during installation tick *Add to the PATH...*.

### Opening command prompt

If **cmake** was installed with Visual Studio Installer, you'll need to run `Developer command prompt for VS` via Windows `Start` menu. If **cmake** was installed with cmake installer, you can run the regular Windows `cmd`.

Inside the prompt navigate to the hlsdk directory, using `cd` command, e.g.
```
cd C:\Users\username\projects\Client-Mod
```

Note: if Client-Mod is unpacked on another disk, nagivate there first:
```
D:
cd projects\Client-Mod
```

### Building

Ð¡onfigure the project:
```
cmake -A Win32 -B build
```
Note that you must repeat the configuration step if you modify `CMakeLists.txt` files or want to reconfigure the project with different parameters.

The next step is to compile the libraries:
```
cmake --build build --config Release
```
`hl.dll` and `client.dll` will appear in the `build/dlls/Release` and `build/cl_dll/Release` directories.

If you have a mod and want to automatically install libraries to the mod directory, set **GAMEDIR** variable to the directory name and **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX** to your Half-Life or Xash3D installation path:
```
cmake -A Win32 -B build -DGAMEDIR=mod -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life"
```
Then call `cmake` with `--target install` parameter:
```
cmake --build build --config Release --target install
```

#### Choosing Visual Studio version

You can explicitly choose a Visual Studio version on the configuration step by specifying cmake generator:
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 -B build
```

### Editing code in Visual Studio

After the configuration step, `CLIENT-MOD.sln` should appear in the `build` directory. You can open this solution in Visual Studio and continue developing there.

## Linux x86

### Prerequisites

Install C++ compilers, cmake and x86 development libraries for C, C++ and SDL2. On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install cmake build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev:i386
```

### Building

```
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

Note that the libraries built this way might be not compatible with Steam Half-Life. If you have such issue you can configure it to build statically with c++ and gcc libraries:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc"
```

## Linux x86. Build in your own chroot

### Prerequisites

Use the most suitable way for you to create an old distro 32-bit chroot. E.g. on Ubuntu/Debian you can use debootstrap.

```
sudo apt install debootstrap schroot
sudo mkdir -p /var/choots
sudo debootstrap --arch=i386 jessie /var/chroots/jessie-i386 # On Ubuntu type trusty instead of jessie
sudo chroot /var/chroots/jessie-i386
```

```
# inside chroot
apt install cmake build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev
exit
```

Create and adapt the following config in /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie.conf (you can choose a different name):

```
[jessie]
type=directory
description=Debian jessie i386
directory=/var/chroots/jessie-i386/
users=yourusername
groups=adm
root-groups=root
preserve-environment=true
personality=linux32
```

Insert your actual user name in place of `yourusername`.

### Building

Prepend any make or cmake call with `schroot -c jessie --`:
```
schroot --chroot jessie -- cmake -B build-in-chroot -S .
schroot --chroot jessie -- cmake --build build-in-chroot
```

## Android

TODO

## Nintendo Switch

### Prerequisites

1. Set up [`dkp-pacman`](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman).
2. Install dependency packages:
```
sudo dkp-pacman -S switch-dev dkp-toolchain-vars switch-mesa switch-libdrm_nouveau switch-sdl2
```
3. Make sure the `DEVKITPRO` environment variable is set to the devkitPro SDK root:
```
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
```
4. Install libsolder:
```
source $DEVKITPRO/switchvars.sh
git clone https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/libsolder.git
make -C libsolder install
```

### Building using CMake
```
mkdir build && cd build
aarch64-none-elf-cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_PROJECT_CLIENT-MOD_INCLUDE="$DEVKITPRO/portlibs/switch/share/SolderShim.cmake" ..
make -j
```

## PlayStation Vita

### Prerequisites

1. Set up [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/).
2. Install [vita-rtld](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/vita-rtld):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/vita-rtld.git && cd vita-rtld
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make -j2 install
   ```

### Building with CMake:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$VITASDK/share/vita.toolchain.cmake" -DCMAKE_PROJECT_CLIENT-MOD_INCLUDE="$VITASDK/share/vrtld_shim.cmake" ..
make -j
```

## Other platforms

Building on other architectures (e.g x86_64 or arm) and POSIX-compliant OSes (e.g. FreeBSD) is supported.

### Prerequisites

Install C and C++ compilers (like gcc or clang), cmake and make.

### Building

```
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

## Build options

Some useful build options that can be set during the cmake step.

* **GOLDSOURCE_SUPPORT** - allows to turn off/on the support for GoldSource input. Set to **ON** by default on Windows and Linux, **OFF** on other platforms.
* **USE_VGUI** - whether to use VGUI library. **OFF** by default. You need to init `vgui_support` submodule in order to build with VGUI.

This list is incomplete. Look at `CMakeLists.txt` to see all available options.

Prepend option names with `-D` when passing to cmake. Boolean options can take values **OFF** and **ON**. Example:

```
cmake .. -DUSE_VGUI=ON -DGOLDSOURCE_SUPPORT=ON -DCROWBAR_IDLE_ANIM=ON -DCROWBAR_FIX_RAPID_CROWBAR=ON
```
